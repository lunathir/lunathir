## Lunathir Saelka's profile
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'll have to continue working on this more, but I can tell you about a few things about myself:
- She/her at least slightly primarily, but I don't particularly mind other pronouns.

### Current Projects
I am currently working on:
- Making a video game for the Sega Megadrive / Genesis (The template I'm using is available, but be warned: it's only 68000 assembly. I might consider a C/C++ variant of it, but not at the moment.)
- Emulator for the previous, but I'd like to make it accurate enough to play games that can only be played on BlastEm or Exodus or something of the sort.
- Making a website for myself
- Getting an iPad for art
- More stuff I can't think of at the moment, but I will update when I remember everything.
